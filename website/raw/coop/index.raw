<h1>Cooperation</h1>

<p>The core feature for the Pipeline is <b>open cooperation</b>: we
sincery hope that many projects will share their crawling efforts,
both in reusing crawled data as in implementation of quality
improvements.  Please join us!</p>

<h2>Current set-up</h2>

<p>At the moment, the "Crawl Pipeline" runs on one server, provided
for free by independ Dutch hosting provider
<a href="https://procolix.com">ProcoliX</a>.
The server runs 6 pipes in parallel.  It is able to process the
<a href="https://commoncrawl.org">CommonCrawl</a> published data-set,
which is 350TB per month.  It runs three Tasks.</p>

<h2>Joining the Pipeline</h2>

<p>You can join in different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>contributing (WARC) archives, collected by your crawler</li>
<li>become a data user: submit you <a href="/explain/tasks.html">Task</a></li>
<li>host a server which runs a set of pipeline processes</li>
</ol>

<p>The preferred contribution is number&nbsp;2: please use our
service instead of processing CommonCrawl data yourself. Let us reuse
resources!</p>
