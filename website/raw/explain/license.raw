<h1>Data Licensing</h1>

<p>What you can do with the data which you receive depends on the
Licenses which are imposed by the Crawlers, the jurisdiction of the actual
Crawler, and the laws in your jurisdiction.  Websites may contain data
which falls under the GDPR: the European privacy laws.  Your Tasks fall
under the European Data Processing regulations.</p>

<p>When you are not storing this data for a long term or transform the
data which breaks GDPR restrictions (for instance, by breaking up texts
into single lines), then you are probably fine.  For other uses, consult
a lawyer.  Together with the <a href="https://opensearchfoundation.org">
Open Search Foundation</a>, we try to establish standard legal rules.</p>
