<h1>Pipeline Tasks</h1>

<p>When you are interested in crawled website information, you
submit a <em>Task</em> to the people running this project.  Tasks
are components which run in the processing pipelines.
Such Task consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>filter rules: which response is useful for you
<li>extract rules: what data would you like to collect from it (knowledge extract effort is shared)
<li>packaging: how the extracted data is transported to you
</ul>

<p>Have a look at the available filters and extraction rules, to see
whether we offer enough to keep you from crawling yourself.</p>
