<h1>Pipeline Tasks</h1>

<p>When you are interested in crawled website information, you
submit a <em>Task</em> to the people running this project.  Tasks
are components which run in the processing pipelines.</p>

<p>Every Task should have exactly one purpose: write different
Tasks when you have different needs.</p>

<h2>Task components</h2>

<p>Each Task has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/filter/">Filter rules</a>: which page contains useful
    data for you;</a>
<li><a href="/extract/">Extraction tools</a>: what data would you
    like to collect from it (knowledge extract effort is shared); and</li>
<li><a href="/package/">Packaging options</a>: how the extracted data
    is transported to you.  Usually downloading zips or WARCs via http
    or ftp.
</ul>
