<h1>Extract the &lt;link&gt; elements</h1>

<p>Links have many different purposes, and more and more are added.
They also have a wide variety in attributes, as can be seen on the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">MDN page about 'link'</a></p>

<p>The links will be <a href="normalize.html">normalized</a> into a
canonical URL: you do not need to clean it up any further.</p>

<h2>Extracted structure</h2>

<p>Sometime webpages have a huge number of links.  The URIs themselves (when a <code>href</code> attribute is present) will also be listed in the references extractor, but this link extractor will take all attribute fields it finds.  The lower-case version of the attribute name is used as key.</p>

<p>Example output:</p>
<JSON>
{  "canonical": [ {
          "href": "https://www.boatjump.com/en_us/rental-of/yacht/puerto-portals"
       }
    ],
    "shortcut icon": [ {
          "type": "image/x-icon",
          "href": "https://www.boatjump.com/assets/favicon/favicon-783e85a14e.ico"
       }
    ],
    "alternate": [ {
          "href": "https://www.boatjump.com/es/alquiler-de/yate/puerto-portals",
          "hreflang": "es"
       },
       {  "href": "https://www.boatjump.com/en/rental-of/yacht/puerto-portals",
          "hreflang": "en"
       }
    ]
