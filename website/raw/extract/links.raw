<h1>Extract the &lt;link&gt; elements</h1>

<p>Links have many different purposes, and more and more are added.
They also have a wide variety in attributes, as can be seen on the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">MDN page about 'link'</a></p>

<p>The links will be <a href="normalize.html">normalized</a> into a
canonical URL: you do not need to clean it up any further.</p>

<h2>Extracted structure</h2>

<p>Sometime webpages have a huge number of links.  The URIs themselves (when a <code>href</code> attribute is present) will also be listed in the references extractor, but this link extractor will take all attribute fields it finds.  The lower-case version of the attribute name is used as key.</p>
