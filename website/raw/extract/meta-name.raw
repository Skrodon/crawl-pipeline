<h1>Name records in &lt;meta&gt;</h1>

<p>When you want more <code>&lt;meta name&gt;</code> records from the
HTML than the limited list offered by the "classic" meta extraction,
you can ask for (any subset) of the full name table.  It includes all
<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements which have both a <code>name</code>
as a <code>content</code> attribute.</p>

<p>For some pages, this output is huge.  There are also groups of
names which may be of your only interest.  Please specify which
fields you like to get.  A long list of names is described on <a
href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions">WhatWG</a>.</p>

<h2>Produced data-structure</h2>

<p>The <code>name</code> attributes are unique.  Both <code>name</code>
and <code>content</code> get leading and trailing white-space
removed. Internal white-space sequences are replaced by 1 blank.</p>

<p>The structural output looks like this in JSON.  The field names are
in random order.</p>
