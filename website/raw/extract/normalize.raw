<h1>URL normalization</h1>

<p>Various extracts contain (relative) URLs.  As long as we now that
the extract contains a URL, we will normalize that into an normalized
(cannonicalized) absolute URL.  This is a complex process.</p>

<p>The main normalization rules are written down in RFC3986 and explained
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_normalization">Wikipedia page
about URI normalization</a>.  But it also handles HTML quircks, as long
as most browsers support them.<p>

<h2>Normalization rules</h2>

<p>We use the Perl module <code>HTML::Inspect</code> to normalize
(partial, relative) URLs found on webpages into absolute, RFC compliant
URLs (not on CPAN yet).</p>

<p>Explicitly, our URIs are created according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>As absolute base for relative URLs, it uses
    <ul>
    <li>the <code>&lt;base href&gt;</code> from the document, otherwise</li>
    <li>the <code>Location:</code> header of the response,</li>
    <li>otherwise the request URI</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>HTML formatting issues are circumvented
    <ul>
    <li>leading and trailing blanks are stripped</li>
    <li>backslashes become forward slashes</li>
    <li>tab, cr, lf, and vt are removed including following blanks</li>
    <li>blanks are recoded to <code>%20</code></li>
    <li>utf8 auth, path and query characters are hex encoded and verified</li>
    <li>utf8 in hostnames is converted into IDN</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>RFC3986 normalizations:
    <ul>
    <li>"<code>../</code>" and "<code>./</code>" removal</li>
    <li>remove repeating slashes</li>
    <li>"<code>+</code>" is recoded to "<code>%20</code>"</li>
    <li>lower-casing scheme</li>
    <li>upper-casing percent-encoded characters</li>
    <li>unneeded percent encodings are removed</li>
    <li>hostnames are lower-cased</li>
    <li>remove trailing dot from hostname</li>
    <li>superfluous port numbers are removed</li>
    <li>superfluous port number digits are removed</li>
    <li>The fragment is removed.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Probably most important: all url components are validated so do not
    need additional checks.</li>
