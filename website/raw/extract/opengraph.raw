<h1>OpenGraph</h1>

<p>The OpenGraph additions to the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> header
of webpages is based on Microsofts hCard.  It seems to be widely
used (by 50% of the pages of our test-set), probably because it
gets automatically added by various content creation platforms.</p>

<p>There are a few extensions to OpenGraph, but we
currently only support structures which are described on <a
href="https://ogp.me">https://ogp.me</a>.  This looks like the best
description.  We do not actively monitor discussion about OpenGraph:
please informm us when there are changes in the standard.</p>

<h2>Output rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>We do handle non-standard prefixes, when they are correctly declared
    via <code>prefix</code> attributes in the HTML anywhere. (But probably
    no-one else does handle this correctly).</li>
<li>When a property MAY have attributes (like <code>og:image</code>) it
    is called a <em>Structure</em>.  We will always return it as a Hash
    (associative array) even when there are not attributes specified.</li>
<li>When a property MAY repeat (be an array, like <code>og:image</code>)
    it will always either be missing from the returned data-set or an
    <em>Array</em>. Even when only found once, it will be returned as Array
    of length one.</li>
</ul>

[TODO: include examples for each of the <code>og.type</code> variations. In JSON format]

<h2>Currently not supported</h2>

<p>Extensions on OpenGraph may be included, when used by multiple
parties. We currently know about the following proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.yoast.com/features/opengraph/extensions-and-addons/">Yoast
    WooCommerce SEO extensions</a>, uses own <code>product</code> and some
    <code>ya:ovs</code></li>
<li><a href="https://yandex.com/support/video/partners/open-graph.html">Yandex
    video extensions</a>. Their <code>ya:ovs:<code> metadata records
    need to be merged inside the preceding video structure.</li>
</ul>
