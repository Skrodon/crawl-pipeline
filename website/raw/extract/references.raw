<h1>Extraction of References</h1>

<p>Many HTML elements contain URIs pointing to other internet locations.</p>

<p>The following attributes are collected when you need all:</p>
<PLAIN>
  a        href
  area     href
  base     href
  embed    src
  form     action
  iframe   src
  img      src
  link     href
  script   src
</PLAIN>

<h2>Extracted data-structure</h2>

<p>All links are collected and converted to the canonical (normalized)
form, then deduplicated.</p>

<p>How and where the data-structure with the facts are transported is
your decision, but the output looks like this:</p>

<JSON>
{
     "form_action" : [
        "https://grupovilanova.es/#wpcf7-f399-p11-o1"
     ],
     "link_href" : [
        "https://grupovilanova.es/",
        "https://www.google.com/"
     ],
     "script_src" : [
        "https://grupovilanova.es/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.min.js?ver=3.5.1"
     ],
     "a_href" : [
        "mailto:info@grupovilanova.es",
        "https://www.facebook.com/VilanovaInmo"
     ]
}
</JSON>

<p>You may select a sub-set for your extraction (for instance only
"img_src") because the full list is really large: average about 150 URLs
per HTML file.</p>

<p>You may also restrict the returned data with the following limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximum links per set</li>
<li>only http/https</li>
<li>only mailto</li>
<li>matching some regular expression, for instance top-level domain
    or extension.</li>
</ul>
