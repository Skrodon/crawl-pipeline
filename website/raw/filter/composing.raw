<h1>Task Composition</h1>

<p>Correctly implementing the <a href="/explain/tasks.html">Tasks</a>
requires deep understanding of the internals of the Pipeline (which also
do change every once in a while), so that's a job we do for you. To be
able to implement the filter, you need to give us a formal description
of your need.</p>

<p>For each of the filter rules you need</p>
<ul>
<li>give it a label, like "A" or "lang_nl";</li>
<li>tell the filter parameter, for instance "language NLD or FRY";</li>
<li>tell whether you would like to get the 'hit' information in the result.
</ul>

<p>Then, use the labels to produce a formula.</p>

<HEADER>Example of Task composition</HEADER>
<PLAIN>
# Filters
html      = any HTML or XML
domain_nl = domain in .nl
lang_nl   = language NLD or FRY
cities    = words "Amsterdam", "Arnhem", "Gouda"
bike      = pattern "bike|bicycle|fiets.*

# Extract
Select where html AND ((domain_nl AND lang_nl) OR cities)
Include hits for bikes and cities

# Packaging
To be downloaded as zip via ftp.
</PLAIN>

<p>There is no strict formalism, so feel invited to use comments and
other clarifying syntax.  But do use the two-step approach: separate
filter steps from filter logic. Constructing the filter is an iterative
process: you probably want to fine-tune your initial attempts.</p>
