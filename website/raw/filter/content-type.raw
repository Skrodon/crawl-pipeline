<h1>Filter on content-type</h1>

<p>Often you want to select Products based on content type, for instance only PDFs of HTML.  You may provide a list of regular expressions or
abstract names like "any html", "html5 only", or "LibreOffice
products".</p>

<p>Some crawlers will only produce a very limited number of types (for
instance, CommonCrawl is more than 90% HTML with accidental other types
like PDF).  Filtering on content-type is therefore useful (for response
status 200 replies)</p>

<h2>Hit information</h2>

<p>When you include the hit is your results, you will get something like</p>

<JSON>
{ "rule": "content type",
  "type": "text/html"
}
</JSON>

<p>The <code>type</code> value is always lower-case and normalized
to IANA definitions and following
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.html">RFC&nbsp;2046</a>.</p>
