<h1>Filter based on content-type</h1>

<p>Often you want to select Products based on content type, for instance only PDFs of HTML.  You may provide a list of regular expressions or
abstract names like "any html", "html5 only", or "LibreOffice
products".</p>

<p>Some crawlers will only produce a very limited number of types
(for instance, CommonCrawl is more than 90% HTML with accidental other
types like PDF).  Filtering is therefore useful (for response status
200 replies)</p>

<h2>Hits information</h2>

<p>When you include the hit is your results, you will get something like</p>

<JSON>
{ "rule": "content type", "type": "text/html" }
</JSON>

<p>The <code>type</code> is always lower-case.</p>
