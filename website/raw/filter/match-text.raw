<h1>Filter based on patterns</h1>

<p>This filter searches for patterns in the extract text for a webpage.
Be aware that the text MAY contain line wraps on unexpected places.
This search is rather expensive.</p>

<p>This filter rule gets configured with PAIRS: the name of the pattern
and its pattern.</p>

<h2>Hit information</h2>

<p>When you include the actual matches in your result, you will get one Hit for each matching pattern.  Each Hit looks like this:</p>

<JSON>
{ "rule": "match text",
  "pattern": "<name>",
  "matches": [ "<match1>", "<match2>" ]
}
</JSON>

<p>Only unique matches are reported.</p>
