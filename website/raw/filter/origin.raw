<h1>Filter based on Origin</h1>

<p>The "Origin" of the crawled data is the (abstract) name of an
organization which has provided the data for the pipeline.  The origin
gives a license to use the data which you MUST comply to.  See the
License page.</p>

<p>You may specify more than one source as one rule. You may also give an
abstract description like "sources which allow me to keep the data for
one month".  On the moment, we do not know which kinds of restrictions
sources impose or users need to have.</p>

<p>Currently defined origins:</p>
