<h1>Filter based on text size</h1>

<p>This filter will return a Hit, only when there is a text extract
for the response, and when this extract has a certain minimum size
(in UTF8)</p>

<p>The text extraction effort is shared.  The text extraction may be
done by the origin (like in the CommonCrawl case), and may have their
own restrictions as well.</p>

<p>You have to specify exactly one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>minimum_size</code>, counts any printable or blanks</li>
<li><code>minimum_chars</code>, counts only printables, not blanks</li>
<li><code>minimum_words</code>, counts "\w+" sequences</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hit information</h2>

<p>When you are interested in the actual counts, you get one of these
three forms:</p>

<JSON>
{ "rule": "requires text", "size": 2345 }                 # minimum_size
{ "rule": "requires text", "size": 2345, "chars": 1234 }  # minimum_chars
{ "rule": "requires text", "size": 2345, "words":  312 }  # minimum_words
</JSON>
