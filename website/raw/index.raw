<h1>Crawl Pipeline</h1>

<p>The "Crawl Pipeline" is an <b>open infrastructural</b> project, which
gives access to data which has been collected by web <em>Crawlers</em>:
automated processes which collect the content of websites.  Instead of
crawling your own data for your own project, you can get your usefull
data from us: cooperation to get better quality, a wider reach, using
less resources.</p>

<p>All public websites together contain more than one PetaByte
of data. At the moment, many organizations run their own crawlers
for their own purpose.  When you switch to use our infrastructure,
you do not have to crawl yourself: just collect the extract which
is required for your project.  You may only need to handle a few
megabytes per day: cheap and fast.</p>

<p>Let us <a href="/explain/">explain</a> the details.</p>

<h2>The infrastructure</h2>

<p>At the moment, the "Crawl Pipeline" runs on one server, with 9 batches
in parallel. It is able to process the CommonCrawl published data-set,
which is 350TB per month. It runs three Tasks.</p>

<p>Have a look at the provided <a href="/filter/">filter rules</a>
and <a href="/extract/">extraction options</a>, to see whether we offer
enough to keep you from crawling yourself.  Can we run your Task?</p>

<h2>Application</h2>

<ul>
<li>The use of our infrastructure is available for <em>free</em> (fair
    use);</li>
<li>You may use the data commercially, but the main use is research
    and education;</li>
<li>You have to respect the GDPR (and other EU law) on the source data,
    which means that each <a href="/projects/">project</a> starts
    with an action plan.
</ul>
