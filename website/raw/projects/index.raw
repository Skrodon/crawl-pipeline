<h2>Example project; Bavarian Food</h2>

<p>One of the first Tasks for the Pipeline was contributed by the
University of Passau (Germany).  It want to detect (and extract)
websites in Bayern (county of Bavaria) which relate to local food.
In the first step, their Task contains all webpages written in German
(under any domain) or in any language under TLD <code>.bayern</code>,
which have an extracted text of at least 300 words.  It also report
discovered city-names.</p>

<h2>Example project; link extract</h2>

<p>For the use of other infrastructural projects, related to the
Skrodon Project, there is link extractor Task.  For each HTML response,
<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, and href/src link
data is collected for further processing.  Links and data are nicely
normalized.</p>
